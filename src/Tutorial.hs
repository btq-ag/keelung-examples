-- | A program that outputs whatever number is given.
echo :: Comp Field
echo = do
  x <- input Private -- request for a private input and bind it to 'x'
  return x -- return 'x'

-- | A program that requests for 2 inputs and does nothing with them
useless :: Comp ()
useless = do
  _x <- inputField Public -- request for a public input and bind it to 'x'
  _y <- inputField Private -- request for a private input and bind it to 'y'

-- | A program that expects the second input to be the square of the first input
square :: Comp ()
square = do
  x <- inputField Public -- request for a public input and bind it to 'x'
  y <- inputField Private -- request for a private input and bind it to 'y'
  assert ((x * x) `eq` y) -- assert that 'y' equals to 'x' squared

-- | A stupid calculator has only 2 operations: addition and multiplication.
--   It takes an Boolean operation flag and 2 inputs, and returns the result.
calculator :: Comp Field

  y <- inputField Public

  return $

-- | A program that requests for 10 inputs and returns the 4th input
fourthInput :: Comp Field
fourthInput = do

-- | A program that asserts all 10 inputs to be 42
allBe42 :: Comp ()

summation :: Comp Field

-- | Birthday voucher example
birthday :: Comp Boolean

-- | A program that outputs the input to the 4th power (without computation reusing)
notReused :: Comp [Field]
notReused = do

-- | A program that outputs the input to the 4th power (with computation reusing)
reused :: Comp [Field]

{- LISTS -}
-- | A program that returns whatever list of length l is given.
echoList :: Int -> Comp [Field]

-- | A program that returns the nth index of a list of length l.
indexList :: Int -> Int -> Comp Field

-- | A program that reverses the input list of length l.
reverseList :: Int -> Comp [Field]
